# rl-examples

A growing collection of reinforcement learning examples written in JavaScript.

**gridworld** is a re-implementation of the dynamic programming demo by Andrej Karpathy (see https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/gridworld_dp.html for a description of what it does and https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs for the original code).

It is available on https://i3games.github.io/rl-examples/gridworld/.

**waterworld** is a simplified re-implementation of the DQN demo by Andrej Karpathy (see https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/waterworld.html for a description of what it does and https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs for the original code).

Main changes: one agent, static items, no walls except canvas boundaries, no data view (yet), rewards = green, bad = red

It is available on https://i3games.github.io/rl-examples/waterworld/.

The code is written in modern JavaScript (see https://github.com/i3games/jsopinion) and uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) for the user interface.
